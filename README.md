# Euphoria [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HeisenBugDev/Euphoria-web.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HeisenBugDev/Euphoria-web)[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/HeisenBugDev/Euphoria-web/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/HeisenBugDev/Euphoria-web)[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/HeisenBugDev/Euphoria-web.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/HeisenBugDev/Euphoria-web)

Euphoria is a game network that is planned to soon launch. It is different in that it tracks your achievements and what you do across multiple games and then sends that data to the website where you can then purchase items for use on any of the games with the points you earned by doing stuff on the servers!

## Helping

Fork the repo, write tests, code a feature, submit a PR.

If you are having problems on mac with bundler, try running this instead `CC=gcc bundle install`. Make sure gcc is a command first.

## Bugs and Planned Features

We are going to be using Trello for doing stuff internally. You can view that [here](https://trello.com/b/BluLqh84/euphoria-web). If you find a bug, please report it by creating an issue on this repo. However, before doing that, please make sure both the Trello board and this repo does not have a ticket opened for it (dupes are bad :sad:).
